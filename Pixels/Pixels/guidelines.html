<p>LowRes Coder has a community to share programs, discuss, learn and have fun. Please follow these rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be nice and respectful with everybody.</li>
<li>There is no place for racism and gender discrimination.</li>
<li>Keep comments relevant to the topic. Don't spam, don't ask for likes and followers.</li>
<li>Feel free to use other people's code to be creative, but don't just post a program without any own changes. Give credit to the authors of the original code (in the source code or the post description).</li>
<li>You may delete comments in your own posts which break with these guidelines. In other posts you can report them.</li>
</ul>
