ABS(X)            The absolute value of X.

ATN(X)            The arctangent of X in radians, i.e. the angle
                 whose tangent is X. The range of the function
                 is
                       -(pi/2) < ATN(X) < (pi/2)
                 where pi is the ratio of the circumference of
                 a circle to its diameter.

COS(X)            The cosine of X, where X is in radians.

EXP(X)            The exponential of X, i.e. the value of the
                 base of natural logarithms (e = 2,71828...)
                 raised to the power X; if EXP(X) is less than
                 machine infinitesimal, then its value shall
                 be replaced by zero.

INT(X)            The largest integer not greater than X; e.g.
                 INT(1.3) = 1 and INT(-1.3) = -2.

LOG(X)            The natural logarithm of X; X must be greater
                 than zero.

RND               The next pseudo-random  number in an implemen-
                 tation-supplied sequence of pseudo-random num-
                 bers uniformly distributed in the range 0 <=
                 RND < 1 (see also 20).

SGN(X)            The sign of X: -1 if X < 0, 0 if X = 0 and
                 +1 if X > 0.

SIN(X)            The sine of X, where X is in radians.

SQR(X)            The nonnegative square root of X; X must be
                 nonnegative.

TAN(X)            The tangent of X, where X  is in radians.
